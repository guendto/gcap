    In brief

gcap is a command line tool for retrieving Youtube closed captions.
The retrieved closed captions are saved in SubRip (srt) file format.
The srt files are saved as "$videoid_$langid.srt".

Make sure you read the manual page for gcap (see Installation below).

Project:
    <http://gcap.googlecode.com/>

Development repository:
    <git://repo.or.cz/gcap.git>


    Installation

This is an optional step, you could just as well copy the bin/gcap
file to your path and start using it. The installation takes care
of generating the gcap(1) manual from bin/gcap but you can also
use "perldoc bin/gcap" if you want to skip the installation
altogether.

Prerequisites:

  * See Makefile.PL for these

If you choose to install:

  * Make sure you REMOVE any earlier version of gcap before you continue

  * INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where gcap will
  be installed, e.g.:

    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/usr/local

  * Typical steps:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
